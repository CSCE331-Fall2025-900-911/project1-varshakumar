                <h3>Service & Leadership Beyond the Classroom</h3>
                <p>Beyond my academic work in computer science, some of the most meaningful experiences that shaped me have come from service and leadership outside the classroom. As President and Choreography Director of my college's a cappella group, I've learned how to guide a team creatively and strategically â€” balancing musical direction, choreography, and competition deadlines while keeping everyone motivated. I've also dedicated time to volunteering at Hindu temples, where I helped organize cultural events and youth programs, which taught me the value of community, humility, and giving back. My love for Indian dance has been another thread running through my life â€” it's not only a creative outlet but also a discipline that's trained me in focus, rhythm, and expressing ideas in ways that connect with people. Altogether, these experiences make me adaptable, collaborative, and passionate about building things â€” whether that's a performance, a community event, or a technical solution.</p>

                <ul class="philosophy-list">
                    <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Whether leading a cappella rehearsals, organizing temple events, or choreographing dance routines, I've learned to adapt my communication style and approach to different audiences and situations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Each of these roles requires working with diverse groups of people, teaching me how to build consensus, delegate effectively, and bring out the best in others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passion for Building:</strong> Whether it's a performance, a community event, or a technical solution, I'm passionate about creating things that bring people together and make a positive impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Awareness:</strong> My involvement in cultural activities has given me a deep appreciation for diversity and the importance of inclusive leadership.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creative Problem-Solving:</strong> The creative aspects of these roles have enhanced my ability to think outside the box and approach technical challenges with fresh perspectives.</li>

They've taught me that the best solutions often come from combining different perspectives and approaches, and that building strong communities is just as important as building great technology.</p>
